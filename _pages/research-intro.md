# Research

We aim to address a fundamental challenge: solving diverse data fusion problems in an era where traditional sensors are gradually being replaced by intelligent computers and robotics. As computing advances, these intelligent agents introduce new complexities in data fusion. Our mission to investigate all research issues that arise in this context, including:

- Security
- Reliability
- Privacy
- Multi-party computation
- And other critical aspects of collaborative intelligence

By tackling these foundational problems, we strive to enable robust, secure, and efficient fusion across distributed intelligent systems.

The Computer Fusion Laboratory (CFL) is part of Temple University's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department under the leadership of Dr. Li Bai. The CFL pursues research in various areas of engineering including autonomous vehicle driving, distributed sensing and computing, multi-agent systems, wireless sensor networks, augmented reality and more. The think tank style laboratory explores what makes our world tick.
