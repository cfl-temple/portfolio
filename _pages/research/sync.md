This project addresses the growing need for supportive technologies as the aging population continues to expand, with older adults striving to maintain independence while relying on caregivers for essential daily assistance. Access to professional care, such as services provided by social workers, is often constrained by workforce shortages, financial limitations, and restricted hours of support. To address these challenges, this work presents an intelligent robotic companion powered by agentic large language models (LLMs) that assists with routine activities, manages medical appointments, and provides medication reminders, enabling social workers to focus on higher-priority needs. The system is designed around the core principles of interpretability, reproducibility, and trustworthiness, achieved through the integration of the n8n framework for transparent orchestration and monitoring of AI-driven functions. By supporting consistent evaluation and adaptability across diverse LLM architectures, the proposed system builds confidence among both users and caregivers. This scalable and reliable solution enhances safety and autonomy for older adults and offers a practical model for home-based healthcare support.
