As the aging population continues to grow, older adults increasingly seek to maintain independence while relying on caregivers for essential daily support. Access to professional care, such as services provided by social workers, is often limited by workforce shortages, financial constraints, and restricted hours of assistance. This work presents an intelligent robotic companion powered by agentic large language models (LLMs) to support routine activities, manage medical appointments, and provide medication reminders, allowing social workers to focus on higher-priority needs. The system is designed around the core principles of interpretability, reproducibility, and trustworthiness, achieved through the integration of the n8n framework for transparent orchestration and monitoring of AI-driven functions. By enabling consistent evaluation and adaptability across diverse LLM architectures, the proposed system builds confidence among both users and caregivers. This scalable and reliable solution enhances safety and autonomy for older adults and offers a practical model for home-based healthcare support.
