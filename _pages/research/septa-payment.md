The objective of this project is to develop a prototype system by using a front end read only approach incorporated with non-proprietary commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. The idea is to use the mobile phone as a communication device and as well as to validate ticket information on the smartcard through a backend sever using the short text message sent by mobile phones. It provides us with physical measurements of time delays and possible bottle necks of the operations. Also, the system can provide coalition members with a generic approach for a read only process system and determine what the feasibly practical onboard ticket sale processes are accordingly.
