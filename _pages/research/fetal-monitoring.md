Wireless fetal monitoring will keep mothers, doctors and babies safer.

During a mother's pregnancy, the physiology and activity of the baby should be frequently monitored to ensure fetal health. But the monitoring comes with an issue that the mother should frequently go to the hospital and suffer from the long monitoring procedure without moving away from bed.

To resolve such a problem, the Wireless Fetal Monitoring (WFM) / Fetal Monitoring Network (FMN) system is proposed. The FMN system takes the concept of Body Sensor Network, which allows sensors be portably attached on human body and transmit data wirelessly to a local sensor processing unit which can be called a base station. Base stations will then relay the data collected to a remote centralized server for further analysis and medical reference.
