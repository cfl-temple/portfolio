This project focused on assessing cyber threats and systemic vulnerabilities in distributed AI systems deployed in battlefield environments, with an emphasis on designing robust mitigation strategies for secure multi-agent intelligence. Conducted at the Computer Fusion Lab at Temple University under the supervision of Dr. Li Bai and funded by the DEVCOM Analysis Center of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, the work involved the development of a realistic battlefield simulation testbed using the SEED network emulator to model adversarial communication conditions. A secure Python-based API was designed to support dynamic group key generation using Tree-based Group Diffie–Hellman (TGDH), enabling resilient and scalable key management among collaborating agents. Building on this foundation, the project introduced a novel homomorphic encrypted federated learning framework that allows secure model aggregation without exposing local client models, thereby preserving data confidentiality under adversarial settings. The framework further integrated CKKS-based homomorphic inference capabilities within the SEED environment, enabling encrypted model evaluation and decision-making in distributed, bandwidth-constrained, and threat-prone operational scenarios.
